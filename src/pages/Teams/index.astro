            The Color Guard Team is the most active team within local events. You will most likely see them, in parades, city gatherings, graduation, football games, and many more important events. Within the color guard you will see our cadets marching with flags surrounded by rifles, hence the name color guard.

            <h2>Rifle Team</h2>
            The Rifle Team is one of our most intense and best teams. Not only do cadets have to learn how to operate an air rifle, they also have to remain consistent and disciplined through out thier journey as this team requires intense commiment and dedication. Cadets will devote multiple hours in physical and mental Training. If you are up to the challange then, Good luck.
